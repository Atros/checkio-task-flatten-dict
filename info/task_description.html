    Nicola likes to categorize everything.
    He categorized all reagents in his laboratory, books in the library and notes on the desk.
    But then he had known about python
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a>
    and categorized all configurations for Sophia drones.
    Now these files are looked as deep nested structure, but Sophia don't like this.
    Let's help Sophia to flatten these dictionaries.
</p>

<p>
    Python dictionaries are a convenient data type to store and process configurations.
    It allows to store data by keys and to create nested structures.
    You are given a dictionary where keys are strings and values are strings or dictionaries.
    The goal is flatten the dictionary, but save all structures in the keys.
    The result should be the new dictionary without nested dictionaries.
    The keys should contains a path that contains parent keys from the original dictionary.
    The keys in the path are separated by "/". If a value is an empty dictionary, then it should be replaced by an empty string
    ("").
    Let's look at example.
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
{
    "name": {
        "first": "One",
        "last": "Drone"
    },
    "job": "scout",
    "recent": {},
    "additional": {
        "place": {
            "zone": "1",
            "cell": "2"}
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    The result will be:
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
{"name/first": "One",           #one parent
 "name/last": "Drone",
 "job": "scout",                #root key
 "recent": "",                  #empty dict
 "additional/place/zone": "1",  #third level
 "additional/place/cell": "2"}
</pre>

<p>
    Sophia already have written the code for this task, but it has a bug.
    <strong>Your should find and fix this bug.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> An original dictionary as a dict.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The flatten dictionary as a dict.
</p>


<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
flatten({"key": "value"}) == {"key": "value"}
flatten({"key": {"deeper": {"more": {"enough": "value"}}}}) == {"key/deeper/more/enough": "value"}
flatten({"empty": {}}) == {"empty": ""}
    </pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This concept can be useful if you need to parse config files and simplify structures for father works.
    You can easily modify this for your own specification.
    And it's useful skill to read code and search bugs.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    <strong>Keys</strong> in a dictionary are strings.<br>
    <strong>Values</strong> in a dictionary are strings or dicts.<br>
    root_dictionary != {}
